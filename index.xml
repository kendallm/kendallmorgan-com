      <description>My employer, Indeed.com, hosts engineering discussion panels and recently I have been a part of our code review discussions. Participating in these panels has forced me think intentionally about how I approach code reviews. This is an attempt to synthesize my approach.
Overview I learn most efficiently when giving and receiving reviews and it seems to stick better than just reading or hearing advice passively. I see them as a way for me to help better others, help better myself, and help better the software that I build.</description>

      <description>A family member came to me and said that he is interested in learning how to program. Reflecting on my experience learning software in academia I started to think about how I would want to learn programming if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do so in school.
There are a few key goals I would want to focus on if I was starting out:
 Have a concrete project in mind. Learn how to get started quickly.</description>
